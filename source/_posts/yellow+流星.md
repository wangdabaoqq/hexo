  作曲 : Coldplay

  作词 : Coldplay/郑钧

  Look at the stars

  Look how they shine for you

  And everything you do

  Yeah they were all yellow

  I came along

  I wrote a song for you

  And all the things you do

  And it was called Yellow

  Your skin

  Oh yeah your skin and bones

  Turn into something beautiful

  Do you know you know I love you so

  You know I love you so

  我纵身跳

  跳进你的河流

  一直游到尽头

  那里多自由

  我许个愿

  我许个愿保佑

  让我的心凝固

  在最美的时候

  情愿坠落在你手中

  羽化成黑夜的彩虹

  情愿不见明媚的天

  不见明媚的天

  Look how they shine for you

  Look how they shine for you

  Look how they shine for

  Your skin

  Oh yeah your skin and bones

  Turn into something beautiful

  Do you know you know I love you so

  You know I love you so

  Look how they shine for you

  Look how they shine for

  Look at the stars

  Look how they shine for you
```
